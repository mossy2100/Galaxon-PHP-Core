/**
 * Trait for objects that can be compared for equality.
 *
 * This trait defines a contract for objects that support equality comparison. Implementations should check for type
 * compatibility and return false for incompatible types rather than throwing exceptions.
 *
 * This is implemented as a trait rather than an interface to enable better composition with other comparison traits
 * like Comparable, ApproxEquatable, and ApproxComparable.
 *
 * For types with a natural ordering (where less than/greater than comparisons make sense), use the Comparable trait
 * instead, which includes equal() along with ordering methods like lessThan(), greaterThan(), etc.
 *
 * @see Comparable For types with natural ordering.
 * @see ApproxEquatable For approximate equality comparison.
