/**
 * Trait providing complete comparison operations with both exact and approximate equality.
 *
 * This trait combines Comparable and ApproxEquatable to provide a comprehensive comparison API for numeric value
 * types that contain floating-point components. It's ideal for types like Rational, Measurement, or other numeric
 * types where both exact ordering and tolerance-based comparison are needed.
 *
 * Classes using this trait get:
 * - All methods from Comparable: compare(), equal(), lessThan(), greaterThan(), etc.
 * - All methods from ApproxEquatable: approxEqual()
 * - Additional method: approxCompare() for three-way comparison with tolerance
 *
 * The approxCompare() method provided by this trait uses approximate equality to determine if two values should be
 * considered equal (within tolerance), and falls back to exact comparison for ordering when they're not approximately
 * equal.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * <code>
 * class Rational
 * {
 *     use ApproxComparable;
 *
 *     public function __construct(private int $num, private int $den) {}
 *
 *     #[Override]
 *     public function compare(mixed $other): int
 *     {
 *         $this->checkSameType($other);
 *         // Exact comparison logic...
 *         return Numbers::sign($this->toFloat() <=> $other->toFloat());
 *     }
 *
 *     #[Override]
 *     public function approxEqual(mixed $other, float $relTol = ..., float $absTol = ...): bool
 *     {
 *         if (!$other instanceof self) return false;
 *         return Floats::approxEqual($this->toFloat(), $other->toFloat(), $relTol, $absTol);
 *     }
 * }
 * </code>

    /**
     * Compare this object with another using approximate equality for the equal case.
     *
     * This method performs a three-way comparison that returns:
     *   -1 if this object is less than the other object
     *    0 if this object approximately equals the other object (within tolerances)
     *    1 if this object is greater than the other object
     *
     * The method first checks if the values are approximately equal within the given tolerances. If they are, it
     * returns 0. Otherwise, it delegates to the exact compare() method to determine ordering.
     *
     * This is particularly useful for sorting operations where you want values within a tolerance to be considered
     * equal, while still maintaining a consistent ordering for values outside the tolerance.
     *
     * Return values are exactly -1, 0, or 1 (not just negative/zero/positive) because convenience methods may rely
     * on strict equality checks.
     *
     * @param mixed $other The value to compare with.
     * @param float $relTol The maximum allowed relative difference (default: 1e-9).
     * @param float $absTol The maximum allowed absolute difference (default: PHP_FLOAT_EPSILON).
     * @return int Exactly -1, 0, or 1 indicating the ordering relationship.
     * @throws TypeError If the types are incompatible for comparison.
     * @see approxEqual() The method used to check approximate equality.
     * @see compare() The method used for exact ordering when not approximately equal.
